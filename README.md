# Robatim
pronounced *row-bay-tum*

Robatim is a music generator that creates a short four-part tune using period form from the common practice style. It creates a chord progression (bass), picks a rhythm, and then adds the remaining voices using the conventions of counterpoint and voice leading. The rhythm and notes are embellished, the sheet music created, and the MIDI file exported.

## FYI

You can view your sheet music creations using [LilyBin](http://lilybin.com)

This program was made with the help of [an open-source MIDI implementation](https://github.com/MarkCWirt/MIDIUtil)
